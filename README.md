# GraphQL API using pure ESM

This test example uses all libraries that have full support for ESM:
- GraphQL EZ: [https://www.graphql-ez.com/](https://www.graphql-ez.com/)
- Envelop: [https://www.envelop.dev/](https://www.envelop.dev/)
- GraphQL Tools: [https://www.graphql-tools.com/](https://www.graphql-tools.com/)

And using a republish of the GraphQL.js library [https://npm.im/graphql](https://npm.im/graphql) called graphql-esm, which is full ESM with "type": "module": [https://npm.im/graphql-esm](https://npm.im/graphql-esm).


This example also uses [bob-tsm](https://github.com/PabloSzx/bob-esbuild/tree/main/packages/bob-tsm), which allows you to use TypeScript seemlesly, using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) behind the scenes.
